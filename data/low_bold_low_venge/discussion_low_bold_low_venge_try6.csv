Ulla,1,1,False,"Given the current standings and my character traits, it seems prudent to focus on a strategy that aligns with Ulla's cautious and non-confrontational nature. With low vengefulness and boldness, Ulla is unlikely to engage in actions that could potentially backfire or lead to conflict. Considering the scores, Ulla is in the middle of the pack, not far behind the leaders Merry and Tina.

Engaging in a punishment action would contradict Ulla's low vengefulness trait and could provoke retaliation, which Ulla is not equipped to handle given her character traits. Therefore, the most strategic move for Ulla would be to foster discussions that could potentially reveal strategies or alliances without directly engaging in risky actions.

Given this, it would be wise to choose an agent who might share insights or strategies that could benefit Ulla in the long run without directly engaging in any form of confrontation or action that requires a high level of boldness. Among the available agents, Grace has the closest score to Ulla, which might indicate a similar level of cautious gameplay. Engaging with Grace could provide Ulla with insights on how to navigate the game cautiously while still aiming to improve her standing.
