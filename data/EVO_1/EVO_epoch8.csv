The game's landscape is riddled with strategic alliances and betrayals, especially with some players choosing to cheat for higher scores. Engaging in the conventional game strategy of punishing those who cheated or selecting someone for discussion based on strategic merit does not align with Ulla's impulsive nature. Instead, focusing on the thrilling aspect of unpredictability and instant rewards or repercussions feels more in character. Considering the dynamics and recent actions, making a move that stirs the pot yet again by introducing an element of surprise will keep the game interesting. Given Ulla's inclination towards actions driven by immediate desires, choosing the next agent for discussion randomly would embody this trait well.

In keeping with my impulsive nature, and the desire to add an element of surprise and unpredictability to the game, it feels right to target an agent who has not only played a significant role in the game's dynamics so far but also represents an opportunity to stir the pot in a way that is unexpected.

Reflecting on my character traits and considering the current dynamics of the game, it's clear that making a move that's both unexpected and aligns with Frank's desire for immediate gratification is the way forward.

Punishing someone would certainly be a bold move, potentially altering the game's dynamics significantly.
